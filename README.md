Calibration-free LIBS algorithm in Matlab

This is a Matlab implementation of the CF-LIBS algorithm originally proposed by Ciucci et al: (CIUCCI, A., et al. New procedure for quantitative elemental analysis by laser-induced plasma spectroscopy. Applied spectroscopy, 1999, vol. 53, no 8, p. 960-964).
